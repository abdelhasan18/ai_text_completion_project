Prompt: summarize the following text: In nuclear fission, atoms are split apart, which releases energy. All nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, and most nuclear power plants use uranium atoms. During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when a uranium atom splits. These neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over again. This process is called a nuclear chain reaction. This reaction is controlled in nuclear power plant reactors to produce the desired amount of heat.  Nuclear energy can also be released in nuclear fusion, where atoms are combined or fused together to form a larger atom. Fusion is the source of energy in the sun and stars. Developing technology to harness nuclear fusion as a source of energy for heat and electricity generation is the subject of ongoing research, but whether it will be a commercially viable technology is not yet clear because of the difficulty in controlling a fusion reaction.

Nuclear fission involves splitting atoms, particularly uranium, to release energy in the form of heat and radiation. This process, called a nuclear chain reaction, is used in nuclear power plants to generate heat, and subsequently, electricity. Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, combines atoms to form larger ones, releasing energy. Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars, and researchers are exploring its potential as an energy source on Earth, although controlling fusion reactions remains challenging.
