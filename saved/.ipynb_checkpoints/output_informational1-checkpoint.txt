Prompt: summarize the following text: In nuclear fission, atoms are split apart, which releases energy. All nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, and most nuclear power plants use uranium atoms. During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when a uranium atom splits. These neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over again. This process is called a nuclear chain reaction. This reaction is controlled in nuclear power plant reactors to produce the desired amount of heat.  Nuclear energy can also be released in nuclear fusion, where atoms are combined or fused together to form a larger atom. Fusion is the source of energy in the sun and stars. Developing technology to harness nuclear fusion as a source of energy for heat and electricity generation is the subject of ongoing research, but whether it will be a commercially viable technology is not yet clear because of the difficulty in controlling a fusion reaction.

The text describes two processes that can release nuclear energy: nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Nuclear fission involves splitting atoms, usually uranium, which releases energy in the form of heat and radiation. This process occurs in nuclear power plant reactors, where it is carefully controlled to generate electricity. During fission, a chain reaction can occur as neutrons released from splitting atoms collide with other uranium atoms, creating more fission events. Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, combines atoms to form larger ones, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This process powers the sun and stars, and researchers are investigating its potential for generating heat and electricity on Earth, although controlling fusion reactions is challenging. While fusion offers a potentially abundant energy source, its commercial viability remains uncertain.
